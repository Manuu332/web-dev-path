        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This webpage is experimental. I would like to see just what I'm capable of.</p>
        
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>For the longest time I've been trying to get into the tech field but there has always been  something holding me back:
            <ul>
                <li>school,</li>
                <li>lack of resources,</li>
                <li>and fear</li>
            </ul>
           But not anymore, I've started learning
        </p>
        
        <h3>Here's how:</h3>
        <p>I was introduced to this platform called <abbr title="Power Learn Project">PLP</abbr> by someone and it was a game changer. It's a non-profit organization focused on tech education in Africa.<br> They can be found at <a href="https://powerlearnprojectafrica.org">https://powerlearnprojectafrica.org </a> <br> Long story short I'm currently enrolled in their July 2025 Cohort. Clearly it's working.
        </p>

        <h2>What I'm Learning</h2>
        <p>I'm still getting acquainted with <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">html.</abbr> It's not as intimadating as I thought it would be and I bet the other languages are just as easy. I've also been made aware of platforms that will help me in my journey, eg:
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://react.dev/">React</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a></li>
            </ol>
        I'm also learning other useful soft skills such as research skills, discipline, commitment and networking.
